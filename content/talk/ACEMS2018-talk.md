abstract_short = "Abstract: Streaming time series data are becoming increasingly common, and we often need to identify anomalous time series within a large collection of non-stationary streaming time series data. We define an anomaly as an observation that is very unlikely given the recent distribution of a given system. First, I will describe a framework that provides early detection of anomalous behaviour within a large collection of streaming time series data using extreme value theory. Second, I will discuss a novel approach for early detection of sudden changes in a time series. The proposed algorithm uses time series features as inputs, and a density-based comparison to detect any significant change in the distribution of the features. The proposed algorithm works well in the presence of noisy non-stationarity data within multiple classes of time series.However the current framework is developed under the assumption that the measurements produced by sensors are one dimensional. The rapid advances in hardware technology has made it possible for many sensors to capture multiple measurements simultaneously, leading ultimately to a collection of multidimensional multivariate streaming time series  data. Therefore, our next attempt  is to extend our proposed framework  to handle a collection of multidimensional streaming data. Extending our proposed algorithm to the detection of anomalies in the multidimensional, multivariate streaming data context may allow us to perform anomaly detection in an even wider range of application domains.
