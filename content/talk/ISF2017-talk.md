The 37th International Symposium on Forecasting was my first ISF experience. It gave me an opportunity to mingle with like-minded people who share the same passion and interest. Getting an opportunity to talk with more advanced researchers, as well as established senior professionals in my filed was a great opportunity  and allowed me to open up new ways of thinking about my research. 

It was held at Cairns Convention Centre where the Great Barrier Reef right on the door step. Thank you ISF2017 for giving me an opportunity to meet the "largest living thing on Earth", the Great Barrier Reef.
