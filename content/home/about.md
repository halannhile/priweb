Hi!

I'm a PhD candidate from Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics,
Monash University, Australia under the supervision of [Professor Rob J. Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/) and
[Professor Kate Smith-Miles](http://katesmithmiles.wixsite.com/home). My research centers around computational statistics. My dissertation focuses on anomaly detection in streaming time series data. I am also interested in general data science problems.

I am passionate about R and  anything that is even slightly related to R. You can find some of my projects [here](https://prital.netlify.com/#projects).

Apart from  research, I like to explore science in nature. Visit me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/prital19), I post mostly about R, Statistics and science in nature.
