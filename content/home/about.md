## About Me 

I'm a PhD candidate at Monash University, Australia, Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics. My research centers around computational statistics. My dissertation focuses on anomaly detection in streaming time series data and I am working under the supervison of [Professor Rob J. Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/) and [Professor Kate Smith-Miles](http://katesmithmiles.wixsite.com/home). I am also interested in general data science problems. 

I am passionate about R and  anything that is even slightly related to R. You can find some of my projects [here](https://prital.netlify.com/#projects).

Apart from  research, I like to explore science in nature. Visit me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pridiltal), I post mostly about R, Statistics, Data Science and science in nature. 

I love travelling, photography and painting.
