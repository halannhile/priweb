### Motivation: Fence-mounted perimeter intrusion detection systems
```{r  out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/1_climb.png")
```
- Data obtained using  fiber optic cables attached to a fence 
--

- Intrusion events cause measurable changes in intensity, phase, wavelength or transit time of light in the fiber.
--

- Aim: Find anomalous time series (the location of the intrusion event)

---

- Approaches to solving the problem of anomaly detection for temporal data :
--
.pull-left[
**Batch scenario**: <br/> whole set of data is available, focus - complete events


```{r   echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("fig/3_batch.png")

```
]
--
.pull-right[

**Data stream scenario**: continuous, unbounded, flow at high speed, high volume

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig_align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/4_stream.gif")


```
]

## Automatic anomaly detection algorithm for streaming data is required:


- to give real-time support



--
-  to provide early detection of anomalies



--
- to learn and adapt to the changing environment automatically (concept drift)



--
- to deal with large amounts of data efficiently

## What is an anomaly ?


- By definition, anomalies are rare in comparison to a system's typical behaviour.




-  We define an anomaly as an observation that is very unlikely given the forecast distribution.


---
## Algorithm of the proposed framework

#### Aim

- To detect anomalous time series within a large collection of time series in a streaming data context

--

#### Main Assumptions

--
- Anomaly is a rare event which has a very low chance of occurrence with respect to the typical behavior of the system
--

- A representative data set of the system's typical behavior is available to define the model for the typical behavior of the system.

--

#### Proposed Algorithm

--

- Off-line Phase: Building a model of a system's typical behaviour; (similar to (Clifton, Hugueny & Tarassenko, 2011))
--

- On-line Phases: Testing newly arrived data using the boundary

## Feature Based Representation of Time series
.pull-left[
- Mean   
- Variance  
- Changing variance in remainder 
- Level shift using rolling window   
- Variance change  
- Strength of linearity 
- Strength of curvature  
 ]

.pull-right[
- Strength of spikiness  
- Burstiness of time series (Fano Factor)  
- Minimum  
- Maximum  
- The ratio between interquartile mean and the arithmetic mean
- Moment 
- Ratio of means of data that is below and upper the global mean

### Dimension Reduction for Time Series 
```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "90%", fig_align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/7_pcspace_ggplot.png")
```
- First two PCs explain 85% of variation

---
## Off-line Phase:

- Estimate the probability density function of the 2D PC space --> Kernel density estimation
- Draw a large number N of extremes from the estimated probability density function

```{r   echo=FALSE, out.width = "90%", fig.cap="Figure: Distribution of 1000 extremes generated from bivariate kernel density function with m=500"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/11_dist_extreme.png")
```

---
## Off-line Phase:

- Define a $\Psi$-transform space, using the $\Psi$-transformation defined by

```{r   echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/12_psitrans.png")
```
- $\Psi$-transform maps the density values back into space into which a Gumbel distribution can be fitted.
```{r   echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%",  fig.cap = "Figure: Distribution of transformed values"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/13_psi_trans.png")
```

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
oddstream::find_odd_streams(train_data, test_stream)
```
```{r   echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/3out.gif")
```
.pull-left[
```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%", fig_align = 'top'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/1out.gif")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "95%", fig_align = 'top'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/2out.gif")
```
]

## What Next?

- Explore more on feature extraction and feature selection methods to create a better feature space suitable for streaming data context.


--

- Use other dimension reduction techniques such as multidimensional scaling analysis, random projection to see the effect on the performance of the proposed framework.


--

- Do more experiments on density estimation methods to get a better tail estimation.


--

- Extend the algorithm to work with Multidimensional Multivariate Data Streams.
