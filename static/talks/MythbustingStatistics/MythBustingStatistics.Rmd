## Origin of Statistics

- The term statistics is derived from
     - **"status"**  - political state   (Latin )
     - **"statista"**  - statesman or politician    (Italian)
--
- Original idea of **"statistics"** was restricted to information about states 
--

- Later extended to include all collections of information of all types
--

- In modern terms, **"statistics"** means both 
   - sets of collected information  
   - analytical work which requires statistical inference

**Data science** is a "concept to unify <span style="color: red">**statistics**</span>, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.

**Timeline of machine learning**

- **<1950s**:	Statistical methods are discovered and refined.
--

- **1950s**: Pioneering ML research is conducted using simple algorithms.
--

- **1960s**:	Bayesian methods are introduced for probabilistic inference in ML
--

- **1970s**:	'AI Winter' caused by pessimism about ML effectiveness.
--

- **1980s**: Rediscovery of backpropagation causes a recovery in ML research
--

- **1990s**:	Work on ML shifts from a knowledge-driven approach to a data-driven approach. 
--

- **2000s**:	Support Vector Clustering and other Kernel methods  and unsupervised ML methods become widespread.
--

- **2010s**	Deep learning becomes feasible, which leads to machine learning becoming 	essential, to many widely used software services and applications.

# GDPR rule

- The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25, 2018.
--

- GDPR Articles 13-15 and 21-22 outline requirements related to automated data processing and decision making. 
--

- The basic concept is that when a decision is generated solely from automated processing (no human intervention), including profiling, the data subject has the right to receive an explanation of how the decision was rendered.
--

- Automated data processing and decision systems typically use machine learning
--

- The problem with many state-of-the-art models is a lack of transparency and interpretability (Hard to explain internal logic and inner workings) 

---

- When it comes to AI, "explanation" could mean several things:

1) How an algorithm works or how the system functions.
      
2) The factors or data that resulted in a decision by the algorithm or system that impacted an individual (a data subject).
--

- But there are projects that aim to produce explainable AI such as the DARPA Explainable AI (XAI) program and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME).

# Statistical Machine Learning

- Statistical Machine Learning is a multidisciplinary field that integrates topics from the fields of Machine learning, Mathematical Statistics, and Numerical Optimization Theory.
--

- Machine learning algorithms require a stronger background in statistics and probability than do most neural network techniques,but even these approaches are often referred to as statistical machine learning or statistical learning, as if to distinguish themselves from the regular, less statistical kind.
