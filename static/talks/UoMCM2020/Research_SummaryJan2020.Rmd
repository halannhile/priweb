### Advantages of the Proposed Algorithm

- Detect micro clusters
--

- Applied to both uni- and multi- dimensional data
--

- Handle large datasets due to the use of a one-pass algorithm
--

- Does not require a training set to build the decision model
--

- Deal with multimodal typical classes
--

- Outlier threshold has a probabilistic interpretation

# Motivation

- Water quality sensors are exposed to changing environments and extreme weather conditions
--

- Two types of anomalies:
--

  1. Water quality breaches associated  with real events 
--

  2. Technical issues in the sensor equipment (low battery power, biofouling of the probes, errors in calibration, rust, sensor maintenance activities etc.)

---

# Limitations of existing work

- Semisupervised approach: requires a representative sample from the typical behaviour
--

- Influenced strongly by the training data used to build the models (Nonstationarity, concept drift)
--

- Require additional time for training for prediction and to perform optimization to estimate the model parameters
--

- Complex relationship between water-quality variables
--

- Irregular time series with lots of missing values (increase the frequency of measurements during high-flow events to capture greater resolution in water-quality dynamics)

# GDPR rule

- The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25, 2018.
--

- GDPR Articles 13-15 and 21-22 outline requirements related to automated data processing and decision making. 
--

- The basic concept is that when a decision is generated solely from automated processing (no human intervention), including profiling, the data subject has the right to receive an explanation of how the decision was rendered.
--

- Automated data processing and decision systems typically use machine learning
--

- The problem with many state-of-the-art models is a lack of transparency and interpretability (Hard to explain internal logic and inner workings) 

---

- When it comes to AI, "explanation" could mean several things:

1) How an algorithm works or how the system functions.
      
2) The factors or data that resulted in a decision by the algorithm or system that impacted an individual (a data subject).
--

- But there are projects that aim to produce explainable AI such as the DARPA Explainable AI (XAI) program and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME).

---
# Why is this important?

- **Data managers**: for quality control and assurance and to increase confidence in the data by reporting the presence of such anomalies; automated correction
- **Sensor maintenance technicians**: to ensure timely and correct calibration and maintenance of equipment
- **Policy and decision makers**: to limit use of incorrect data and for reporting purposes
- **Public**: to avoid false warning of water quality breaches
- **Sensor manufacturers**: to improve performance, e.g. extend battery life, improve wiper quality to further minimize biofouling
- **Statisticians**: for AD methods to better detect other non-trivial anomaly types and/or for methods requiring regular and frequent observations.
